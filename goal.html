Goal Progression Notes <br />
EIN 00041<br /><br /><br />
Subject A<br />
Our newly supplemented knowledge indicates subject isnâ€™t as far behind as we initially guessed. Removal from society for direct observation does mean our goal for A cannot be reached, however we can project social aspects from existing knowledge and measure progression in related skills to see if the goal would theoretically have been reached.<br /><br />
Subject B<br />
Significantly farther ahead than planned for this point in time regarding talent and abilities. On track in most other respects, behind in ambition and motivation.<br /><br />
Subject C<br />
While less compliant than is ideal, on track in most areas. Lifestyle choices are counter to staying on track - intervention will be necessary soon.<br /><br />
