Pre Commitment Medical Notes<br />
EIN 00078<br />
These notes detail observations on the subjectâ€™s physical and mental states that are not encompassed in testing.<br />
 <br />
Please take this excerpt in mind before deciding on proposition 13vq.<br /><br />
Gender Presentation<br />
All subject bases are neutral in design, but all have presented both feminine and masculine aspects. This design did little to prevent gendered expression - subject A is closest to neutral presentation, but merely in that they lean no more heavily to femininity than masculinity. Subject A still presents both in moderate amounts. Subject B has embraced aspects farthest into any area of the gender presentation spectrum. Markedly feminine - it seems that some of our employees have taken to gendering the subject. Continual notices are sent out as a reminder to not.<br /><br />
It has been recommended that no corrective action be taken. All physical development is within acceptable parameters and other elements have larger effects than presentation. Also note, mental development is affected positively by this. Reference comparative data: basic mental analysis.<br />
