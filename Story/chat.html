#####: were they supposed to end up having abilities?<br /><br />
#####: the way the 000’s talk, it sounds like a side effect?<br /><br />
#####: Side effect! hahahaha<br /><br />
#####: But real talk - if it’s a side effect of genetic manipulation, that means they don't have control over it<br /><br />
#####: which means it might not be replicateable<br /><br />
#####: i don’t think that’s a word?<br /><br />
#####: Whatever you know what I mean<br /><br />
#####: i wonder if it’s a gamble. you know how their abilities kind of correspond to whatever we did manipulate?<br /><br />
#####: Yeah - they do perfectly. Well C is weird but I kind of get it<br /><br />
#####: well maybe the next round of subjects will have totally different abilities, but in the same wheelhouse<br /><br />
#####: Oooh. That could be fun<br /><br />
#####: right??<br /><br />
#####: omg I bet ##### will start a betting ring on types of abilities<br /><br />
#####: Holy shit they totally would do that<br /><br />
#####: in all seriousness, you know the 000’s are going to want to figure this out. they'll want it mapped to genes<br /><br />
#####: Yeah. Knowing them? They'll try to turn this place into some kind of superpower factory<br /><br />
#####: this is real life. i don’t want to deal with people who have real superpowers<br /><br />
#####: Same. But we should really get back to work<br /><br />
#####: ugh you’re right. we can chat about our predictions after<br /><br />
#####: Yessss I can’t wait for shift switch<br /><br />
