#####: were they supposed to end up having abilities?<br /><br />
#####: Doesn’t sound like it…the way the 000’s talk, it sounds like a side effect<br /><br />
#####: side effect! hahahaha<br /><br />
#####: But real talk - if it’s a side effect of genetic manipulation, that means they don't have control over it, and can’t map it to a gene<br /><br />
#####: which means it might not be replicateable<br /><br />
#####: i don’t think that’s a word?<br /><br />
#####: Whatever you know what I mean<br /><br />
#####: i wonder if it’s a gamble. you know how their abilities kind of correspond to whatever we did manipulate?<br /><br />
#####: Yeah - they do like, perfectly. Well C is a little weird but I kind of get it<br /><br />
#####: well maybe the next round of subjects will have totally different abilities, but in the same wheelhouse<br /><br />
#####: Oooh. That could be fun<br /><br />
#####: right??<br /><br />
#####: omg I bet ##### will start a betting ring on types of abilities<br /><br />
#####: Holy shit they totally would do that<br /><br />
#####: in all seriousness, you know the 000’s are going to want to figure this out. they'll want exact control over replication<br /><br />
#####: Yeah. Knowing them? They'll try to turn this place into some kind of superpower factory<br /><br />
#####: that would be a shame, i like the whole low key super freak genius ability thing. it’s less anime and more scifi novel<br /><br />
#####: You have a problem with anime?<br /><br />
#####: no lmao i like it i just. this is real life you know. i don’t want to deal with people who have real superpowers. that’d change the world TOO much<br /><br />
#####: Okay we have to stop this conversation now. I totally agree, but we’re going to set off some system flags if we go down that road<br /><br />
#####: ugh you’re right. we can chat about our predictions after work<br /><br />
#####: Yessss I can’t wait for shift switch<br /><br />
