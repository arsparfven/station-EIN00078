EIN 68105<br />
Revision Note - EIN 71922: Please stop using “giggle” to describe B’s laughter. 19387 is a special circumstance; do not copy them.<br /><br /><br />
A: Hay!<br /><br />
B: Huh?<br /><br />
A: Over here!<br /><br />
B: Oh, ah, hi!<br /><br />
A: Who are you? You sound normal - why are you here?<br /><br />
B: I’m part of a trial. Are you in one too?<br /><br />
A: Wh-no. No. Listen to me, this place is not what it seems. Or it kind of is exactly what it seems, in a way. Trust me, I’ve counted the security staff and cameras and every not so subtle attempt at manipulation.<br /><br />
B: Uhm…<br /><br />
A: You need to get out of here. This place is dangerous - these people…are not okay.<br /><br />
B: I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. These people are totally nice.<br /><br />
A: It’s a facade. They want you here willingly, you’ll be easier to work with. I didn’t want to stay. Now I can’t get out. You got offered a false choice.<br /><br />
B: My therapist was my guidance counselor…you’re saying that they…<br /><br />
[Subject B giggles]<br /><br />
B: Planted someone in my middle school? All to get me to stay here for a week, like, over a decade later?<br /><br />
A: Yes.<br /><br />
B: Okay. You know that sounds crazy, right?<br /><br />
A: . . . Yes.<br /><br />
B: And like, you’re talking to me through a vent.<br /><br />
A: I get how this looks.<br /><br />
B: Alright, just checking.<br /><br />
A: I’m serious. You should leave while you still have a chance.<br /><br />
B: Look, uhm…<br /><br />
A: Just pay more attention to them. You’ll notice it. We’re just test subjects to them. Experiments. We’re not people and they don’t care about us. Not really.<br /><br />
B: Ah…<br /><br />
A: Promise me you’ll at least pay more attention.<br /><br />
B: Okay, I can do that. I promise that I’ll pay more attention.<br /><br />
A: And when you notice, leave.<br /><br />
B: And if I notice, leave.<br /><br />
A: Okay.<br /><br />
B: You know, even if you are crazy, I’ll come back to keep talking to you.<br /><br />
A: What?<br /><br />
B: I mean, even if all of this is in your head, it’s real to you. And you’re trying to warn me so I can escape. And be safe. That’s like, really nice. And you’re not even asking for help.<br /><br />
A: Oh I- ah-<br /><br />
B: So you’re a good person. I like good people - I’ll come back to talk whenever you want.<br /><br />
A: That- thanks. That’s actually a nice thought. I don’t have anyone else over here.<br /><br />
B: Sounds lonely. Also kind of scary.<br /><br />
A: It’s terrifying.<br /><br />
