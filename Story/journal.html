Reference 5b Journal Excerpts<br />
Censor’s Note - EIN 90014: All names have been redacted.<br /><br />
Journal Excerpt 5411092b<br />
I told –––– about ––––. He agrees that she’s probably crazy. But he also agreed that this place is pretty freaking weird. And it is pretty freaking weird if I think about it. I never really have because I’m been visiting this place for so long…but it’s not normal. It’s almost like some research lab, or military science place, or I don’t know. I’ve been more wary. So has ––––. But…also, everything seems fine? So…I don’t know.<br /><br />
Journal Excerpt 5411103b<br />
I’ve managed to talk to –––– a few more times. Sorry, 3 more times. That’s what –––– would say - she always knows the number of everything. It’s funny in a dorky way. It’s hard to hear through the vent, but I think she sings. I really like her. I liked her before finding that out but, now I really like her. –––– sings too, but it’s not quite as clear, it doesn’t ring quite as nicely.<br /><br />
Journal Excerpt 5411116b<br />
–––– didn’t show up…again. I’m worried. I can’t ask anyone about her because I think she’d get in trouble if I did. The last time I asked about [REDACTED] which was weird. I’ll talk to –––– tomorrow about this.<br />
