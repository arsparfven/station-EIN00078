Transcription of Audio from Camera DY-61002<br /><br />

B: ––––!!! Where have you been?!!<br /><br />

A: They found out about us meeting. They put me in solitary confinement.<br /><br />

B: Wh…wait really?<br /><br />

A: It’s not like the movies - it was a few rooms. Enough chances to escape still.<br /><br />

C: How did you even-<br /><br />

A: There’s no time. But essentially lock picking. Oh uhm, nice to meet you. But we need to go, talk later.<br /><br />

C: But-<br /><br />

A: The cameras can pick up audio. That’s the only way they could have found out about us meeting. I know the location of every camera, every security patrol route, every employee kiosk in the area I was locked into.<br /><br />

B: There was no camera on my side of the vent either!<br /><br />

A: So they can likely hear us right now, there has to be a camera nearby.<br /><br />

C: How could you possibly know all of that? What…are you like some kind of inside agent?<br /><br />

A: What? No. I just counted them all. Over and over again until I was sure I had every single one.<br /><br />

C: What does that-<br /><br />

B: ––––, let’s go. Let’s follow ––––. After all our doubts, after what we’ve seen…I trust ––––. <br /><br />

C: …okay. You’re right. And I think –––– is our best shot at getting out of here, if –––– is right, anyway. And if –––– is wrong, well, nothing bad will happen to us.<br /><br />

A: I’m sorry to be so rude but can we please get going-<br /><br />

B: Right! Sorry!<br /><br />
