Unidentified Journal Entry<br /><br />

I question why I keep a diary often. I shouldn’t - not working here. Even more so, I shouldn’t continue updating it - not doing what I’ve done. Yet. I think I’m afraid. Afraid that nothing will seem real afterwards without proof. Afraid that I’ll be caught, and nothing will remain of me. <br />

In a way, I became a researcher here to leave a mark on the world. I compromise my morals for access to science I think can change the world, at least. Maybe this journal is a last ditch effort to leave something behind. And if I can’t do something, perhaps I can leave a record of my attempts.<br />
