My team dedicated to AI research has made a great breakthrough. Though we need a starting template to work off of, we can essentially create a fully functioning brain out of computers. I know all the work we do here is progressive but, this is beyond genetic engineering. This is unprecedented. I can’t believe we’re keeping these findings private. I’m so frustrated…but I can’t pass up an opportunity like this. I can’t leave because of morals. Not until this project is completed. <br />
