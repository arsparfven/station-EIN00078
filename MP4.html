Transcription of MP4 from Unidentified USB<br /><br /><br />
C: I don’t know this is kind of embarrassing.<br /><br />
B: Aw…c’mon, it’ll be fun!<br /><br />
A: It is a nice sentiment.<br /><br />
B: See!<br /><br />
C: Fine. When does it start?<br /><br />
B: It already has!<br /><br />
C: What?!<br /><br />
[B laughs]<br /><br />
A: So ah - this video is being recorded in case well, we don’t make it.<br /><br />
B: Or! It’s in case we do make it - to look back on the beginning of our friendship.<br /><br />
A: Or that. But more likely in case we don’t make it. I’ve counted out about -<br /><br />
B: Shhhhhhhh.<br /><br />
C: I agree with B on this one, we really don’t need to know the exact number of ways that we could get caught.<br /><br />
A: Oh, ah, okay.<br /><br />
B: Right so! Introductions! I’m ——— and I’m a musician! I play piano in an orchestra and ah…I love ukelele! I’m learning cello and bass right now…Sometimes I sing, and-<br /><br />
C: ———, it’s introductions, not monologues.<br /><br />
B: Wh…Pfffft. Okay.<br /><br />
C: I’m –––––. Hobbies include uh. Well, I like video games and knitting.<br /><br />
B: Cute!<br /><br />
C: Hay! Uh. Yeah whatever.<br /><br />
A: Right and I’m –––––. I work as a junior architect. I like, well, I don’t know, I suppose technology? I have some plants, big fan of those. Sometimes I do math puzzles for fun.<br /><br />
B: Also cute!<br /><br />
C: Stop that!<br /><br />
B: You can’t make me!<br /><br />
A: Guys.<br /><br />
C: Right. So we met one week ago.<br /><br />
A: Actually, 6 days, 21 hours, and 36 minutes ago for me and –––––. I didn’t meet you until 2 days and-<br /><br />
C: Okay okay. We all arrived here one week ago.<br /><br />
A: And it’s been hell for me, personally.<br /><br />
C: That’s skipping ahead - we all came here because we thought we could get medical help here.<br /><br />
B: We each have some pretty crazy brain stuff going on. But like, in a totally not harmful way.<br /><br />
C: Just a really annoying and vaguely disruptive way.<br /><br />
A: I don’t think that the brain stuff is…natural, I suppose you could say? I think that this organization is using us as experiments or test subjects.<br /><br />
C: Admittedly this place is pretty freaking weird.<br /><br />
A: Pretty freaking weird isn’t even the start. Everyone here -<br /><br />
B: Wait…isn’t this video supposed to be about us?<br /><br />
C: It is about us?<br /><br />
B: I don’t want to talk about this place…<br /><br />
A: I thought telling people what happened to us here was the point of the video?<br /><br />
B: I want to talk about our friendship!<br /><br />
A: This is the context for our friendship!<br /><br />
B: I thought that like…the point of this video was to distract us from…you know…<br /><br />
A: It’s kind of hard to stay distracted when literally yesterday I watched 24 armed security guards trash the room we were hiding in.<br /><br />
C: Oh boy okay maybe we should actually figure out what the point of this video is before we record it?<br /><br />
B: That’s…not a bad point…<br /><br />
A: Okay I’m going to stop the camera-<br /><br />
B: Let’s plan for take two!
