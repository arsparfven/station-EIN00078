Transcription of Handwritten Note<br />

EIN 14298 - Note appears to be from Subject B to Subject C. Intercepted before delivery. Names have been redacted.<br />
<br />
It’s been so nice with you here this week. I’ve never met anyone with something like I have. We’re different but, I don’t know. You’re really cool! Let’s stay friends outside of here too, okay?<br />

But anyway, I can tell you that in person. And I will! But the rest of this I can’t tell you in person. <br />

––––– has gone missing. They missed meeting three days in a row. I know that we’ve been here less than a week, I know we leave in like, one day, I know this might sound like I’m catching crazy but...what if ––––– isn’t crazy? I don’t know if I ever really believed they were, despite what we’ve said. You’ve had doubts too. We were talking multiple times a day. They wouldn’t just disappear like this.<br />

Will you help me find out information about ––––– ? If this place isn’t like ––––– thinks - well, someone will tell us right? But just in case it is…maybe we should be careful.<br />

Thanks ahead of time, ––––– . Whatever happens, I’m here for you! Even if you can’t be here for me on this. I understand. I know what I’m asking. I’m just glad to be friends.<br />
