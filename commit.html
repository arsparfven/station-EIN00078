Subject A<br />
EIN 83991<br /><br /><br />
There are no less than 17 different ways that I could die in any situation. Often more, but never less. My brain counts them as it thinks of them, because it counts everything it comes across. I’ve taken three sets of stairs on my way here: 3, 20 (with a landing after stair 15), and 12. I’ve touched my face 621 times since I woke up. Made eye contact with 14 people. Taken 5,768 breaths. I don’t know why I’m like this, but I can’t shut it off.<br /><br />
Yes I am functional. I understand why you would ask that - surprisingly, there is space left in my brain to think about other things. The numbers are just mixed in. And I’m not superhuman - I mostly count things about myself. I don’t really count things about other people. Or the environment. Unless it might directly affect me. Like in one of the 21 scenarios that could kill me now.<br /><br />
I said no less than 17. In this particular instance I’ve got 21. That could increase at any moment, though, of course.<br /><br />
Well, I think it was a strange question to start with. Just asking it - it leads to all sorts of weird implications.<br /><br />
[Subject A laughs and gestures between us]<br /><br />
Anxious? Oh, hm, I suppose that makes sense. I’m not bringing my count down though.<br /><br />
Ah - um. Yes. Of course. This is all a bit intimidating isn’t it? Honestly you might want to invest in some cozier decor. My last place had 7 plants, 3 mismatched chairs, and 12 windows. Did wonders for atmosphere. And it was like…a third of the size? A quarter the size? I didn’t have a chance to estimate the floor plan actually. I should…no. The point is, this place…it’s surgical.<br /><br />
Stay? Ah yeah, no. Note taken or not, this place won’t change overnight. And even if it did, I wouldn’t…that’s…so weird? What?<br /><br />
I’m not committing to a week on the spot like that - that’s crazy. I’d rather live my life and take my time. We haven’t even had our session yet! Honestly this is all, very strange. I think I’ll be looking elsewhere.<br /><br />
[Subject A stands]<br /><br />
Yes elsewhere, thank you for your time but this is just not a good match for me.<br /><br />
[Subject A turns to the door]<br /><br />
Excuse me?<br /><br />
[Subject A turns back]<br /><br />
What does that mean?<br /><br />
This…I…what…<br /><br />
[Subject A cuts me off by attempting to exit the room]<br /><br />
What the fuck? What the…fuck?<br /><br />
You…you can’t do this. This is. Literally illegal. You have to let me out of this room. You-<br /><br />
Complicated? Complicated! You think…this…you…<br /><br />
[Subject A begins laughing hysterically]<br /><br />
Nobody will believe that. I’ve never even come close.<br /><br />
What?<br /><br />
Let me out.<br /><br />
Let. Me. Out.<br /><br />
How, exactly? Are you going to use force?<br /><br />
Excuse me?<br /><br />
[EIN 53591 enters the room]<br /><br />
Oh fuck no…<br /><br />
[Subject A advances on me]<br /><br />

Commitment Interview - EIN 19387<br />
Censor’s Note - EIN 71928: EIN 19387 has difficulty describing the subject in neutral language. Some has been removed, but not all for sake of clarity. What remains is unedited.<br /><br /><br />
I don’t get nervous. I mean, maybe I do, but it’s just background noise if anything. Easy to drown out. I mean, you know how it is. Constant cacophony of life and all that.<br /><br />
Of course. Same as ever!<br /><br />
I knew you would ask that, you always ask that. Okay. So I spend most of my like, brain energy on making all the noise sound like-<br /><br />
Oh right. Starting over. So, everything makes noise. Lots of noise. So much noise because there are so many things all of the time. Soooo [please excuse any mispellings in attempt to capture subject’s unique cadence] I spend most of my brain energy on making all the noise sound nice. I focus really hard on different parts of the cacophony to find a, uh, hidden symphony. I turn all this horrible noise into pretty music.<br /><br />
Yes literally. I hear it all, all of the time. Things are always making noise. Even things that aren’t supposed to, because, well I don’t know. But they do, and I can hear them. My favorite things are things that sing.<br /><br />
You knoooow all of this, why are you asking?<br /><br />
Aaaegh okay fine. Fair enough.<br /><br />
It’s more like, drowning. But in noise. It can be overwhelming and it seems like reality is just on the other side of the surface of the water but you just can’t quite ever break through. But the water is made out of noise.<br /><br />
My least favorite things, are things that scream. I hate those. I have to fix them or get them far, far away.<br /><br />
Pffffft.<br /><br />
[Subject B giggles]<br /><br />
How would you feel if you had someone hanging around you just screaming constantly all of the time?<br /><br />
I survive by finding music. Music is why we - why anything, exists. Well music and quiet. Some things are just quiet - and calm, and peaceful. Some things sound like rain or wind. All of my clothes are wonderfully quiet - I refuse to wear anything that’s loud. I mean, gosh, it would just be, on you all day, being all, aegh no thanks!<br /><br />
I do! Everyone says I’m pretty good - but I’ve heard so much better.<br /><br />
No problem!<br /><br />
Sounds good. Someone already took my things to my room, I think?<br /><br />
Cool!<br /><br />
 <br />
 <br />

Subject C<br />
EIN 21008<br /><br /><br />
Yeah totally - so is this like a sleep study?<br /><br />
Oh right yeah yeah, double blind kind of thing I’ve got you. Are you involved with the study?<br /><br />
That makes sense. Oh well, you said other people might be involved right?<br /><br />
Cool cool. So like, do they have the same thing as me?<br /><br />
[Subject C scoffs] Oh come on you know.<br /><br />
Fine I’ll humor you. Does anyone else have the whole…<br /><br />
[Subject C gestures around their head]<br /><br />
Like the whole, freaky time thing?<br /><br />
Oh, that’s a shame. But I bet they must have something freaky if they’re in the same study as me.<br /><br />
Right right, uh, yeah. So like, sometimes uh. Man I hate explaining this, it’s, well like I said it’s freaky time shit.<br /><br />
Sorry, right. So time passes weird for me sometimes. Like too fast, or too slow. Honestly it can be pretty cool - I think I have it figured out a little bit. Don’t get me wrong like, it happens without my input all the time which sucks. Like really bad, I cannot explain how inconvenient this shit is sometimes. But if I’m in the right uh, mental state, and like I focus really hard, and the planets align or whatever, I swear I can make it happen in the direction I want. Occasionally.<br /><br />
Cool cool. Let’s do this thing. I brought my pillow just in case it uh, is a sleep study. I don’t know sometimes they lie to you about the purpose of the study because they need unbiased data or whatever.<br /><br />
[Subject C laughs]<br /><br />
Right. Look I know how this kind of thing goes man. But I trust you enough.<br /><br />
