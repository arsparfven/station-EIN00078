Unidentified Journal Entry<br /><br />

I’m hiding them. I’m hiding them and I’m going to get caught and I’m going to be killed. I know all of that and I’m still hiding them.<br />

This has escalated beyond emails arguing for their freedom, beyond talking back to superiors in meetings. That makes sense though - the experiment has escalated as well. To keep these people here forever - these are human beings. What they want to do is something you can’t do to human beings.<br />

I’m going to get caught. I know that. But I have a plan to get them out. Between –––––’s ability to memorize security details and my inside knowledge, I truly believe this will work. <br />

Ideally they’ll get out without anyone noticing. I’m not very idealistic, though. Knowing that in the end I’m going to get caught anyway made deciding my backup plan very easy. I’m done no matter what happens - so if need be, I’ll sacrifice myself to buy them time.<br />
