C: I think A’s right<br /><br />

B: why???<br /><br />

C: so I’ve been thinking<br /><br />

C: and paying attention to the cameras so I can avoid them<br /><br />

C: and I went exploring last night<br /><br />

B: isn’t everything locked down?<br /><br />

C: a lot is. but not everything. and I don’t know but…<br /><br />

B: but??<br /><br />

C: I overheard some employees talking. it almost sounded like…idk. like they see us as test subjects. like we’re not people or something. just like A said<br /><br />

B: they could just be a bit morally corrupt<br /><br />

C: or they could be using us for something, and none of this is really our choice<br /><br />

B: …I like A but…I don’t want them to be right about this…<br /><br />

C: neither do I<br /><br />

C: but that doesn’t change the facts<br /><br />

C: you are right about the morally corrupt thing though. this isn’t proof of anything bigger<br /><br />

C: I just…the more I pay attention, the more weird all of this is<br /><br />

C: I should have just signed up for a fucking sleep study<br /><br />

B: hahaha<br /><br />

B: let’s investigate tomorrow night together, okay?<br /><br />

C: 11PM?<br /><br />

B: it’s a date!<br /><br />
