#####: were they supposed to end up having an ability?<br /><br />
#####: honestly doesn’t sound like it…the way the 000’s talk, it sounds like a side effect<br /><br />
#####: side effect! hahahaha<br /><br />
#####: but real talk - if it’s a side effect of the genetic manipulation, that means they can’t map it to a gene…which means it might not be replicateable<br /><br />
#####: i don’t think that’s a word?<br /><br />
#####: whatever you know what I mean<br /><br />
#####: i wonder if it’s like a gamble, since. you know how their abilities kind of correspond to what we tried to amp up?<br /><br />
#####: yeah - they do like, perfectly. well C is a little weird but I kind of get it<br /><br />
#####: well maybe the next round of subjects will have totally different abilities, but in the same wheelhouse<br /><br />
#####: oooh. that could be fun<br /><br />
#####: right??<br /><br />
#####: omg I bet ##### will start a betting ring on types of abilities<br /><br />
#####: holy shit they totally would do that<br /><br />
#####: in all seriousness, you know the 000’s are going to want to figure this out though. they won’t let it stay random<br /><br />
#####: jeesh yeah. knowing them? theyll try to turn this into some kind of superpower or something<br /><br />
#####: that would be a shame, i like the whole low key super freak genius ability thing. it’s less anime and more scifi novel<br /><br />
#####: ha you have a problem with anime?<br /><br />
#####: no lmao i like it i just. this is real life you know, i don’t want to deal with people who have superpowers and stuff. that’d change the world like, TOO much<br /><br />
#####: oookay we have to stop this conversation now. I totally agree, but we’re going to set off some system flags if we go down that road<br /><br />
#####: ugh you’re right. we can chat about our predictions after work<br /><br />
#####: yessss I can’t wait for shift switch<br /><br />
