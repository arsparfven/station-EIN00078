Pre Commitment Personality Notes<br />
EIN 00078<br />
Subject C remains the hardest to get information regarding emotional state. Full mental analysis will not be possible outside of prolonged direct observation. Like the other subjects, subject C’s intellect has been rated far above average - but subject C’s general willingness to engage is markedly low. All subjects are regarded positively in their social spheres, yet subject C is the only subject to remain emotionally closed off to others. This could be a beneficial trait, but it hinders measurements using our current methods. Subject does not appear to be negatively affected by this trait, corrective action should be postponed until more data is collected.
