Time Breakdown Memo 37xb<br />
EIN 87022<br />
It has been determined that Subject A first breached confinement quarters during the 3AM shift change. Currently unsure how soon Subjects B and C went missing after this. Subjectsâ€™ disappearances noted by staff at 7AM when they entered for routine wakeup procedures.<br />
All personnel deny seeing any of the subjects; subjects avoided all security cameras. Further data is being collected to build more accurate timeline. Presently, subjects are presumed to still be on the premises.<br />
